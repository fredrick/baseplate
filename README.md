Baseplate is a quick, easily fetchable starting point. It doesn't assume any particular libraries, but is rather a gentle convention to starting your next web development project.

##Overview
    
    javascripts/

This is where your javascript files reside. There's even a blank `main.js` at the ready.

    stylesheets/
    
Life would boring without some flair. Baseplate conveniently includes a `reset.css` to wipe the slate clean across all browsers. `style.css` is a blank canvas waiting for some loving.

    index.html
    
A basic, 18 line starting point. It's got nothing but the bare necessities. `index.html` even loads Baseplate's few included assets for maximum performance.
